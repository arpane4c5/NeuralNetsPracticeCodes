# NeuralNetsPracticeCodes

This repository contains codes I created while practicing for simple/complex neural network implementations. The codes may or may not be efficient. The focus is to get a hands-on the neural network libraries like Caffe, Torch, Theano etc. The datasets that might be used, are not uploaded here, but the download links for the same can be found in the comments. I try my best to explain the code in the comments. 

Anyone is welcome to give inputs and make a contribution to the codebase.
